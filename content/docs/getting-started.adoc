== Getting Hop
* https://artifactory.project-hop.org/artifactory/hop-snapshots-local/org/hop/hop-assemblies-client/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/[Download] a recent Hop build.
* unzip hop
* go to your newly created 'hop' directory
* start hop-ui.sh/bat

== What Works
* start Hop UI: run hop-ui.sh/bat
* start the new database dialog preview: ./dbd.sh
* start Hop server: './hop-server.sh <HOST> <PORT>', e.g. './hop-server.sh localhost 8000'
* run jobs and transformations through Hop Server using the https://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/8.2/Developer_Center/REST_API/Carte[Carte API]

== What doesn't work
* new job/transformation through right-click or menu options are broken until XUL is completely gone (https://project-hop.atlassian.net/browse/HOP-3[HOP-3]). As a workaround, double clicking on the job, transformation, database connection items in the View tab opens a new item.
