== Getting Started with Hop
* https://artifactory.project-hop.org/artifactory/hop-snapshots-local/org/hop/hop-assemblies-client/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/[Download] a recent Hop build.
* unzip hop to a local directory
* change to the hop directory

== Introducing Hop
Hop is a metadata driven environment where you manage your data processing workflows.

Before anything else, we need to explain Hop's two main concepts:

* **Workflow** is a (by default) sequential process that has a starting point and one or more endpoints.
Between the start and endpoint, a variety of 'actions' can be performed. These actions can range from executing other workflows or pipelines, archiving files that were processed, sending error messages or success notifications and much more.

* **Pipelines**  are more granular items of work. A pipeline is where the actual work is done. Pipelines consist of a chain of transforms that read, process or write data.
Depending on the execution engine your pipelines run, this can be in batch, streaming or a hybrid mode.

The following tools are at your disposal to work with Hop flows and pipelines:

* the **Hop Gui** is your visual IDE to build, preview, run, test, deploy, ... workflows and pipelines.
* the **Hop Server** is a lightweight web server that provides a REST api to run workflows and pipelines remotely.
* **Hop Run** is a command line utility to run workflows and pipelines.

== The Hop GUI

The Hop Gui is your local development environment to build, run, preview and debug (work)flows and pipelines.

=== Start the Hop GUI

On Linux:
[source,bash]
 ./hop-gui.sh

On Windows:
[source,bash]
hop-gui.bat

=== Hop GUI Walkthrough

After starting the Hop Gui, you'll be presented with a window like the one below.
image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-hop-gui.png[Hop Gui , 75% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-hop-gui.png"]

After clicking the 'New' icon in the upper left corner, you'll be presented with the window below.
Choose either 'New Job' or 'New Transformation' (TODO: replace screenshot after refactoring to 'new Flow' and 'New Pipeline').

=== Build Your First Pipeline

==== Concepts
Pipelines consist of two main work items:

* **transforms** are the basic operations in your pipeline. A pipeline typically consists of a lot of transforms that are chained together by hops.
Transforms are granular, in the sense that each transform is designed and optimized to perform one and only one task. Although one transform by itself may not offer spectacular functionality, the combination of all transforms in a pipeline is makes your pipelines powerful.

* **hops** link transforms together. When a transform finishes processing the data set it received, that data set is passed to the next transform through a hop.
Hops are uni-directional (data can't flow backwards). Hops only buffer and pass data around, the hop itself is transform-agnostic, it doesn't know anything about the transforms it passes data from or to.
Some transforms can read from or write to other transforms conditionally to or from a number of other transforms, but this a transform-specific configuration. The hop is unaware of it.
Hops can be disabled by clicking on them, or through right-click -> disable.

==== Add Transforms

Click anywhere in the pipeline canvas, the area where you'll see the image below.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-click-anywhere.png[Hop - Click Anywhere, 45% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-click-anywhere.png"]

Upon clicking, you'll be presented with the dialog shown below. The search box at the top of this dialog works for transform, name, tags (TODO) etc.
Once you've found the transform you're looking for, click on it to add it to your pipeline. An alternative to clicking is arrow key navigation + enter.
Repeat this step now or whenever you want to add more transforms to your pipeline.
Once you've added a transform to your pipeline, you can drag to reposition it.

TODO: link to transform documentation.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-add-transform.png[Hop - Add Transform, 75% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-add-transform.png"]

Add a 'Generate Rows' and a 'Add Sequence' transform, and your pipeline should like the one below.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-add-two-transforms.png[Hop - Add two transforms, 75% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-add-two-transforms"]


==== Add a Hop

There are a number of ways to create a hop:

* shift-drag: while holding down the shift key on your keyboard. Click on a transform, while holding down your primary mouse button, drag to the second transform. Release the primary mouse button and the shift key.
* scroll-drag: scroll-click on a transform , while holding down your mouse's scroll button, drag to the second transform. Release the scroll button.
* click on a transform in your pipeline to open the 'click anywhere' dialog. Click the 'Create hop' image:/img/getting-started/icons/HOP.svg[Create hop, 25px, align="bottom"] button and select the transform you want to create the hop to.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-create-hop.png[Hop - Create Hop, 65% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-create-hop"]

=== Run your first Pipeline

Click the 'run' button image:/img/getting-started/icons/run.svg[Run, 25px, align="bottom"] in your pipeline toolbar

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-run-pipeline-dialog.png[Hop - Create Hop, 75% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-create-hop"]

Let's walk through the options in this dialog

* Pipeline run configurations, edit, new, manage your run configurations. Run configurations are used to specify a name, description and engine to run your pipeline.
* Log level: choose the log level for your pipeline. The available options are
** nothing
** error
** minimal
** basic
** detailed
** debugging
** Row Level (very detailed)
* Clear log before running (enabled by default): logging information from previous runs will be cleared from the logging tab.
* parameters: This table will show the parameter name, default value and description. enter your runtime parameters in the 'value' field.
* variables: add the variable name and value you want to set in this tab.
* always show dialog on run (enabled by default): You'll be presented with this dialog every time you run this dialog. When disabled, the pipeline will run with the default options.

Click the 'New' button right next to the 'Pipeline run configuration'.
Give your run configuration a name and (optionally) a description. Choose the 'local pipeline engine'. As the name implies, the 'local single threaded pipeline engine' runs the pipeline in a single CPU thread. The default 'local pipeline engine' will create a separate CPU thread for each transform in your pipeline to evenly spread the load of your pipeline over your CPU cores.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-run-configuration-dialog.png[Hop - Run Configuration Dialog, 75% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-run-configuration-dialog"]

Click 'Ok' to create your configuration and select it from the dropdown list.
For this getting started guide, we'll leave all other options to the defaults. Click 'Launch'.

Since we haven't saved our pipeline yet, you'll be prompted to do so by the dialog below.

image:/img/getting-started/getting-started-save-pipeline.png[Hop - Save Pipeline, 55% , align="left" , link="/img/getting-started/getting-started-save-pipeline"]

Your pipeline will finish in a matter of milliseconds, and the 'Execution Result' view will show up at the bottom of your IDE.
This view has 5 tabs:

* transformation metrics: transformName, read, written, input, output, update, rejected, errors, buffers input, buffers output, speed, status (TODO: elaborate)
* logging: the logging output for your pipeline
* preview data: a preview of the data for the selected transform. This grid shows the data as it passed through this transform.
* metrics: TODO
* performance graph: TODO
