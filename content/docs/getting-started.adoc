== Getting Started with Hop
* https://artifactory.project-hop.org/artifactory/hop-snapshots-local/org/hop/hop-assemblies-client/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/[Download] a recent Hop build.
* unzip hop to a local directory
* change to the hop directory

== Introducing Hop
Hop is a metadata driven environment where you manage your data processing workflows.

A 'flow' or 'workflow' is a (by default) sequential process that has a starting point and one or more endpoints.
Between the start and endpoint, a variety of 'actions' can be performed. These actions can range from executing other workflows or pipelines, archiving files that were processed, sending error messages or success notifications and much more.

Pipelines are more granular items of work. A pipeline is where the actual work is done. Pipelines consist of a chain of transforms that read, process or write data.
Depending on the execution engine your pipelines run, this can be in batch, streaming or a hybrid mode.

The following tools are at your disposal to work with Hop flows and pipelines:

* the **Hop Gui** is your visual IDE to build, preview, run, test, deploy, ... workflows and pipelines.
* the **Hop Server** is a lightweight web server that provides a REST api to run workflows and pipelines remotely.
* **Hop Run** is a command line utility to run workflows and pipelines.

== The Hop GUI

The Hop Gui is your local development environment to build, run, preview and debug (work)flows and pipelines.

=== Start the Hop GUI

On Linux:
[source,bash]
 ./hop-gui.sh

On Windows:
[source,bash]
hop-gui.bat

=== Hop GUI Walkthrough

After starting the Hop Gui, you'll be presented with a window like the one below.

After clicking the 'New' icon in the upper left corner, you'll be presented with the window below.
Choose either 'New Job' or 'New Transformation' (TODO: replace screenshot after refactoring to 'new Flow' and 'New Pipeline').

=== Create your first Pipeline

Your new pipeline is created, and you'll see the dialog below.

Let's walk through the top toolbar:
